<p><strong>HealthGateway Terms of Service</strong></p>
<p>
    Use of the Health Gateway service (the <strong>"Service"</strong>) is governed by the following terms and
    conditions. Please read these terms and conditions carefully, as by using the Service you will
    be deemed to have agreed to them. If you do not agree with these terms and conditions,
    please do not use the Service.
</p>
<p>
<p><strong>1. The Health Gateway Service</strong></p>
<p>
    The Service provides residents of British Columbia with access to their health information
    (<strong>"Health Information"</strong>).  It allows users to, in one place, view their Health Information from
    various Provincial health information systems, empowering patients and their families to manage their health care.
</p>
<p><strong>2. Your use of the Service</strong></p>
<p>
    You may only access your own Health Information using the Service.
</p>
<p>
    If you choose to share the Health Information accessed through this Service with others (e.g.
    with a family member or caregiver), you are responsible for all the actions they take with
    respect to the use of your Health Information.
</p>
<p>
    You must follow any additional terms and conditions made available to you in relation to the
    Service.
</p>
<p>
    Do not misuse the Service, for example by trying to access or use it using a method other
    than the interface and instructions we provide.  You may use the Service only as permitted
    by law.  We may suspend or stop providing the Service to you if you do not comply with
    these terms and conditions, or if we are investigating a suspected misuse of the Service.
</p>
<p>
    Using the Service does not give you ownership of any intellectual property rights in the
    Service or the content you access.  Don’t remove, obscure, or alter any legal notices
    displayed in connection with the Service.
</p>
<p>
    We may stop providing the Service to you, or may add or create new limits on the Service,
    for any reason and at any time.
</p>
<p><strong>3. Service is not a comprehensive health record or medical advice</strong></p>
<p>
    The Health Information accessed through this Service is not a comprehensive record of your health care in BC.
</p>
<p>
    This Service is not intended to provide you with medical advice or replace the care provided 
    by qualified health care professionals. If you have questions or concerns about your health, 
    please contact your care provider.
</p>

    Your personal information will be collected by the Health Gateway (Ministry of Health) and 
    Service BC under the authority of section 26(c) of the Freedom of Information and Protection 
    of Privacy Act for the purpose of providing access to your health records. Your personal 
    information such as name, email and cell phone number will be shared with other public 
    health service agencies to query your health information and notify you of updates. Your 
    personal information will not be used or disclosed for any other purposes.
</p>
<p>
    The Service’s notes and comments features allow you to enter your own notes to provide 
    more information related to your health care. Use of these features is entirely voluntary. Any
