    <p><strong>1. The Health Gateway Service</strong></p>
    The Service provides residents of British Columbia with access to their health information (<strong>""Health
        Information""</strong>). It allows users to, in one place, view their Health Information from various Provincial
    health information systems, empowering patients and their families to manage their health care.
</p>
<p><strong>2. Your use of the Service </strong></p>
<p>
    You may only access your own Health Information using the Service.
</p>
<p>
    If you choose to share the Health Information accessed through this Service with others (e.g. with a family member
    or caregiver), you are responsible for all the actions they take with respect to the use of your Health Information.
</p>
<p>
    You must follow any additional terms and conditions made available to you in relation to the Service.
</p>

    Do not misuse the Service, for example by trying to access or use it using a method other than the interface and
    instructions we provide. You may use the Service only as permitted by law. We may suspend or stop providing the
    Service to you if you do not comply with these terms and conditions, or if we are investigating a suspected misuse
    of the Service.

    We may stop providing the Service to you, or may add or create new limits on the Service, for any reason and at any
    time.

<p>
    Use of the Health Gateway service (the âServiceâ) is governed by the following terms and conditions. Please read
    these terms and conditions carefully, as by using the Service you will be deemed to have agreed to them. If you do

    <p><strong>1. The Health Gateway Service</strong></p>
    The Service provides residents of British Columbia with access to their health information (<strong>""Health
        Information""</strong>). It allows users to, in one place, view their Health Information from various Provincial
    health information systems, empowering patients and their families to manage their health care.
</p>
<p><strong>2. Your use of the Service </strong></p>
<p>
    You may only access your own Health Information using the Service.
</p>
<p>
    If you choose to share the Health Information accessed through this Service with others (e.g. with a family member
    or caregiver), you are responsible for all the actions they take with respect to the use of your Health Information.
</p>
<p>
    You must follow any additional terms and conditions made available to you in relation to the Service.

    Do not misuse the Service, for example by trying to access or use it using a method other than the interface and
    instructions we provide. You may use the Service only as permitted by law. We may suspend or stop providing the
    Service to you if you do not comply with these terms and conditions, or if we are investigating a suspected misuse
    of the Service.

    We may stop providing the Service to you, or may add or create new limits on the Service, for any reason and at any
    time.
